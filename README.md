Project Title
Predictive Analytics for Retail Sales Optimization

Brief One Line Summary
A time series forecasting project to predict daily sales for 1,115 retail stores using Facebook Prophet, accounting for promotions, holidays, and seasonal trends.

Overview
For companies to remain competitive and grow, they must leverage machine learning to develop predictive models that can forecast future sales. This project demonstrates how to build such a model for a large retail chain. By analyzing historical data, the model learns patterns related to seasonality, holidays, and promotions to generate accurate future sales predictions.

Problem Statement
The sales department for a company with over a thousand stores needs to accurately predict future daily sales. This forecasting ability is crucial for optimizing inventory management, scheduling staff, and planning marketing promotions. The objective of this project is to build a reliable time series model that can provide these critical daily sales forecasts.

Dataset
This project utilizes two datasets containing historical sales and store information:

train.csv: Contains the core time series data. Each row represents a single store's sales on a given day.

Features: Store, DayOfWeek, Date, Sales (Target Variable), Customers, Open, Promo, StateHoliday, SchoolHoliday.

store.csv: Contains supplementary, static information about each of the 1,115 stores.

Features: StoreType, Assortment, CompetitionDistance, Promo2 (information on continuing promotions).

The data files are included in this repository for reproducibility.

Tools and Technologies
Python, Pandas for data merging, cleaning, and manipulation.

Facebook Prophet for building the time series forecasting model.

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization and plotting forecasts.

Colab Notebook for the development environment.

Methods
Data Preprocessing & Merging: The train.csv and store.csv datasets were merged to create a single, comprehensive dataset for modeling. Missing values, particularly in CompetitionDistance, were handled appropriately.

Feature Engineering: The Date column was used as the primary time index. Features like Promo, StateHoliday, and SchoolHoliday were used as special events or "holidays" within the Prophet model to capture their impact on sales.

Time Series Modeling: Facebook Prophet was used to build the forecasting model. Prophet works by decomposing a time series into three main components:

Trend: Non-periodic changes in the data. Prophet automatically detects trend changepoints.

Seasonality: Periodic changes, such as weekly and yearly cycles.

Holidays: The effects of promotions and holidays, which occur at irregular intervals.

Forecasting & Visualization: After training on the historical data, the model was used to generate predictions for future dates. The results were visualized, showing the historical data, the model's fit, and the forecasted sales with uncertainty intervals.

Key Insights
The model successfully captures strong weekly and yearly seasonality in sales data, identifying peak shopping days and seasons.

Promotional events (Promo) were found to have a significant positive impact on daily sales.

The model can effectively forecast future sales, providing a valuable tool for business planning and resource allocation.

Dashboard/Model/Output
A trained Prophet model saved as a Python object.

The primary output is a forecast plot that visualizes historical sales, the model's predictions, and future forecasted values along with their confidence intervals.

A components plot that breaks down the forecast into its constituent parts: trend, weekly seasonality, and yearly seasonality.

How to Run This Project?
To open any notebook from this repository directly in Google Colab, simply copy the notebook's GitHub URL, replace github.com with githubtocolab.com, and paste the new URL into your browser. The dataset is included, so the notebook should run without any additional setup.

Results & Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the power of Facebook Prophet for retail sales forecasting. The resulting model provides accurate and interpretable sales predictions, empowering the business to make data-driven decisions regarding inventory, staffing, and marketing efforts, ultimately leading to improved efficiency and profitability.
