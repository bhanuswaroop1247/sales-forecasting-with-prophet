# **Project Title: Predictive Analytics for Retail Sales Optimization**

### **Brief One Line Summary**
A time series forecasting project to predict daily sales for 1,115 retail stores using Facebook Prophet, accounting for promotions, holidays, and seasonal trends.

### **Overview**
For companies to remain competitive and grow, they must leverage machine learning to develop predictive models that can forecast future sales. This project demonstrates how to build such a model for a large retail chain. By analyzing historical data, the model learns patterns related to seasonality, holidays, and promotions to generate accurate future sales predictions.

### **Problem Statement**
The sales department for a company with over a thousand stores needs to accurately predict future daily sales. This forecasting ability is crucial for optimizing inventory management, scheduling staff, and planning marketing promotions. The objective of this project is to build a reliable time series model that can provide these critical daily sales forecasts.

### **Dataset**
This project utilizes two datasets containing historical sales and store information:
1.  **`train.csv`**: Contains the core time series data. Each row represents a single store's sales on a given day.
    * **Features:** `Store`, `DayOfWeek`, `Date`, `Sales` (Target Variable), `Customers`, `Open`, `Promo`, `StateHoliday`, `SchoolHoliday`.
2.  **`store.csv`**: Contains supplementary, static information about each of the 1,115 stores.
    * **Features:** `StoreType`, `Assortment`, `CompetitionDistance`, `Promo2`.

The data files are included in this repository for reproducibility.

### **Tools and Technologies**
* **Python**, **Pandas** for data merging, cleaning, and manipulation.
* **Facebook Prophet** for building the time series forecasting model.
* **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for data visualization and plotting forecasts.
* **Colab Notebook** for the development environment.

### **Methods**
* **Data Preprocessing & Merging:** The `train.csv` and `store.csv` datasets were merged to create a single, comprehensive dataset for modeling.
* **Feature Engineering:** Features like `Promo`, `StateHoliday`, and `SchoolHoliday` were used as special events within the Prophet model to capture their impact on sales.
* **Time Series Modeling:** Facebook Prophet was used to decompose the time series into trend, seasonality, and holiday components to build the forecast.
* **Forecasting & Visualization:** After training, the model generated future predictions, which were visualized to show historical data, model fit, and forecasted sales with uncertainty intervals.

### **Key Insights**
* The model successfully captures strong weekly and yearly seasonality in sales data.
* Promotional events (`Promo`) were found to have a significant positive impact on daily sales.
* The forecast provides a valuable tool for business planning and resource allocation.

### **How to Run This Project?**

### **Results & Conclusion**
This project successfully demonstrates the power of Facebook Prophet for retail sales forecasting. The resulting model provides accurate and interpretable sales predictions, empowering the business to make data-driven decisions regarding inventory, staffing, and marketing efforts.
